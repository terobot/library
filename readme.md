#library

Sandbox project to test and try things such as drag and drop cards. Code in many places quite bad and hard coded, but it was never an intention to have it polished and maintainable and emphasis was on learning to do some frontend stuff with plain JS, HTML and CSS.

Note avoiding 'this' is intentional.
